# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the AI Workshop Malta: LLM in Scientific Papers course! This guide will help you set up your environment and get started with the learning materials.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabboraron/AI_workshop_Malta.git
cd AI_workshop_Malta
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
We recommend using Python 3.8 or higher. Create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv llm_env

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
llm_env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source llm_env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For minimal setup (if you have limited resources):
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### 4. Configure API Keys (Optional)
If you plan to use commercial LLM APIs:

```bash
# Copy the configuration template
cp config.template.yaml config.yaml

# Edit config.yaml and add your API keys
# Note: config.yaml is in .gitignore so your keys won't be committed
```

### 5. Test Your Setup
```bash
# Test the text preprocessor
python tools/preprocessing/text_preprocessor.py

# Test basic LLM operations (requires transformers)
python examples/basic_llm_usage/basic_operations.py
```

## üìö Learning Path

### Week 1: Foundations
1. **Read**: `notes/module-1-foundations/README.md`
2. **Practice**: Complete exercises in `exercises/module-1/`
3. **Experiment**: Try examples in `examples/basic_llm_usage/`

### Week 2: Scientific Applications
1. **Explore**: Tools in `tools/` directory
2. **Analyze**: Sample papers in `papers/` directory
3. **Build**: Your own text processing pipeline

### Week 3-4: Advanced Topics
1. **Study**: Resources in `resources/` directory
2. **Develop**: Custom applications for your research
3. **Collaborate**: Contribute to the repository

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

### Text Processing
- **Text Preprocessor**: Clean and prepare scientific documents
- **Citation Extractor**: Parse and analyze citations
- **Keyword Extractor**: Identify key terms and concepts

### LLM Integration

- **Batch Processor**: Efficiently process multiple documents

### Analysis Tools
- **Similarity Analyzer**: Compare document similarity
- **Topic Modeler**: Discover themes in scientific literature
- **Performance Evaluator**: Assess model performance

## üìñ Key Resources

### Essential Papers
- Start with the foundational papers in `papers/foundational/`
- Focus on papers relevant to your research domain
- Use the paper analysis template provided

### Online Resources
- Hugging Face documentation and tutorials
- Course-specific resources in `resources/README.md`
- Community forums and discussion groups

### Example Workflows
- Literature review automation
- Research hypothesis generation
- Scientific writing assistance

## ü§ù Getting Help

### Self-Help Resources
1. Check the README files in each directory
2. Review the examples and documentation
3. Look at the troubleshooting sections

### Community Support
1. Use GitHub issues for bug reports
2. Start discussions for questions
3. Join the course forum (if available)
4. Collaborate with peers on exercises

### Common Issues

#### Installation Problems
- **Issue**: Package conflicts or version incompatibilities
- **Solution**: Use a fresh virtual environment and update pip

#### Memory Issues
- **Issue**: Out of memory when running large models
- **Solution**: Use smaller models (e.g., DistilBERT instead of BERT)

#### API Errors
- **Issue**: Authentication or rate limiting errors
- **Solution**: Check API keys and implement proper rate limiting

## üéØ Success Tips

### For Beginners
- Start with the basic examples before attempting complex tasks
- Focus on understanding concepts before optimizing performance
- Practice with small datasets before scaling up
